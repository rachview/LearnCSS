        <!-- r is the radius, cx and cy is where the circle is located on the x/y axis--making it centered. In order to get it to be center, half the number from the svg's height and width--so 250/2=125 -->
        <!-- The circle will not overflow out, allowing for clipping -->
        <!-- Fill defaults to black, so to have transparent fill make sure to include none -->
        <!-- Order matters, to have items in the back, place them top to bottom--so it back to front. Layers! -->

        <!-- rectangle, doesn't need the full word -->
        <!-- Define using x, y. This is the top left of rectangle, and the height and width will spread out from this point -->
        <!-- Height and width 200px, svg's total 250px, so 25 (half of 50--in the 250) places the rectangle in the center of the x and y axis  -->
        <!-- Change radius through using rx and ry, allows for cool shapes. The X axis must have a value(curve) or the Y can't be played with-->
        <!-- If rx and ry are the same, 100 100, it will give a circle, like border-radius=50% -->
